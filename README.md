# üéØ Cap Sorting Robot

A mini robotic system that automatically sorts plastic bottle caps to the left or right based on their color.  
Built with sensors, motors, and a custom-made conveyor belt, all controled by an Arduino Uno.  
Developed as part of a university project in a 3-person team ‚Äî combining hardware design, automation logic, and teamwork.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Arduino UNO
- Color sensor
- Servo motors / DC motors
- Custom conveyor belt
- Basic electronic components (wires, resistors, power supply)
- Arduino IDE (C++)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. A plastic cap is placed on the moving conveyor belt.
2. A color sensor reads the color of the cap.
3. Based on the detected color, a motorized arm redirects the cap to the left or right bin.
4. The belt continues moving, and the process repeats.

The project focuses on simple but effective sorting logic and offers a basic introduction to automation systems in real-world applications.
